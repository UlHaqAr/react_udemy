react apps run in the browser and not in the server. we dont have to wait for server response to render a page.
react component can be thought of as custom html components.

basic needs to create build flow:
	- dependency management - react/reactDOM
	- bundler - webpack
	- compiler - babel
	- dev server to test code on our local machine 
	
npm install create-react-app -g
navigate to path where u wanna create react folder
create-react-app <name> --scripts-version 1.1.5

inside 'public' folder u will find 'index.html' and it has a div with id 'root'. this is where we
will mount our reacta app.
the manifest.json has all the meta data.

src folder :
	- App.js has the component(class) which is imported by index.js and rendered to the 'root' div in index.html.
